## [3.0.0] â€“ 2019-06-10
### Added
- Populate "description" as per `@JsonPropertyDescription` (falling-back on `@JsonClassDescription`).
- Apply alternative field names defined in `@JsonProperty` annotations.
- Ignore fields that are deemed to be ignored according to various `jackson-annotations` (e.g. `@JsonIgnore`, `@JsonIgnoreType`, `@JsonIgnoreProperties`) or are otherwise supposed to be excluded.
